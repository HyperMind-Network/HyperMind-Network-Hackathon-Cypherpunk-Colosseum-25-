## 🧩 Core Protocols of Conscious Learning  

HyperMind Network is built upon three foundational protocols that bridge **human consciousness**, **education**, and **technology**:  

### ⚖️ The Karma Ethic Protocol  
A reputation and trust system that connects users’ contributions, integrity, and community impact to their digital identity.  
It promotes conscious action and ethical participation across the ecosystem.  

### 💫 The LGMO Protocol  
Rooted in **Leadership, Growth, Mindfulness, and Optimism**, this protocol defines the human and energetic foundation of the HyperMind Network.  
It guides how learners, creators, and leaders evolve within the ecosystem.  

### 🧠 The Learning Protocol  
The adaptive structure that links knowledge, energy, and evolution.  
It ensures that learning experiences within HyperMind are measurable, rewarding, and aligned with each individual’s growth journey.  

Together, these protocols create a living system where **technology follows consciousness**, not the other way around.
