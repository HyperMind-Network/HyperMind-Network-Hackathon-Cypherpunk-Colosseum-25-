## 🪙 HMN Token Overview

**Token Name:** HyperMind Network Token (HMN)  
**Standard:** SPL Token (Solana Program Library)  
**Blockchain:** Solana  
**Type:** Utility & Governance Token  

The **HMN Token** is the native currency of the **HyperMind Network** and functions as both a **utility** and **governance** asset across the ecosystem.  
It powers the Learn & Earn model, staking mechanisms, DAO governance, and regenerative funding pools.  

**Core Utilities:**  
- Access to premium courses, certifications, and content.  
- Participation in DAO voting and ecosystem governance.  
- Staking for yield, trust-based rewards, and social impact dividends.  
- Incentives for creators, mentors, and learners within the platform.  

**Governance:**  
The **HyperMind DAO** governs the ecosystem, where token holders use HMN to propose, discuss, and vote on decisions regarding:  
- Educational grants and funding allocation.  
- Platform development and integrations.  
- Community and ecosystem partnerships.  

**Solana Advantages:**  
- Ultra-fast transactions (400ms block time).  
- Extremely low fees (fractions of a cent).  
- Scalable infrastructure for decentralized education and AI modules.  
- Compatibility with Solana smart contracts, NFTs, and staking protocols.

## 🧬 Core Protocols

### ⚡ The LGMO Protocol  
Rooted in *Leadership, Growth, Mindfulness, and Optimism*.  
Defines the spiritual and psychological architecture behind human learning and empowerment.

### 🌀 The Learning Protocol  
Structures human development as an energy flow — aligning self-awareness, practice, and creation.

### 🔮 The Conscious Intelligence Stack  
Integrates AI, blockchain, and gamification into a unified consciousness-based network for global learning.

---

## 💠 Integration with Karma Protocol
Developed by **Julián Marcelo Bacallao Estrada**, the Karma Protocol introduces decentralized trust scoring — aligning reputation, contribution, and consciousness.

Together with HyperMind’s systems, this forms a **synergistic web of learning, trust, and growth**.
